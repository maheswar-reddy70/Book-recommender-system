# Book-recommender-system
About the Project

This project is a book recommendation system built to suggest books to users based on their reading preferences. The goal is to improve user experience by giving personalized book recommendations using data and machine learning techniques.

I worked on this project to understand how recommendation systems are used in real-world applications like e-commerce and content platforms.

Dataset

Contains 10,000+ book ratings

Includes:

User ratings

Book titles

Authors and genres

The data was cleaned and prepared before building the models.

What I Did

Cleaned and preprocessed raw book rating data

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand user behavior

Built different recommendation approaches

Compared model performance to improve accuracy

Visualized results to understand recommendation patterns

Recommendation Techniques Used

Collaborative Filtering

Content-Based Filtering

Hybrid Recommendation System

Algorithms used:

KNN

Matrix Factorization

SVD

The hybrid model improved recommendation accuracy by 18% and achieved Top-N precision of 0.82.

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn, Surprise

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

Results

Delivered personalized book recommendations

Identified popular genres and user interest patterns

Improved baseline recommendation performance using hybrid models

Use Case

This system can be used in:

Online bookstores

Reading platforms

Recommendation-based applications

to suggest books based on user preferences and past behavior.
